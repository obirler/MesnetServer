## Mesnet Logger
Mesnet Logger is a logging service for Mesnet program families. The server will be used as crash reporter, gathering statistical data, gathering telemetry data and control panel for Mesnet and its derivatives (MesnetMD and possibly Mesnet3D) in the future.

The logger service will be used in the future in the applications below:

**Mesnet**: Two-dimensional frame analyzer program that uses Moment Distibution Method. It is in beta version now and it is open-sourced. It is already in use by students in ITU.

**MesnetMD**: Two-dimensional frame analyzer program that uses Matrix Dispalacement Method (a kind of Finite Element Method). The program is in development stage and has no release version.

**Mesnet3D**: A prospective Three-dimensional analyzer program that is also supposed to use Matrix Dispalacement Method but in three dimensional space. It is in concept design stage.

The web service was written in Python Programming Language and developed by [Yusuf TEMİZ](https://bitbucket.org/mytemiz/) and [Ömer BİRLER](https://bitbucket.org/omerbirler/).
